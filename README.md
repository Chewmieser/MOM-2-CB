MOM 2 CB
--

MOM 2 CB is a set of MSSQL exports to translate between Dydacomp's Mail (now Multichannel) Order Manager to ConnectedBusiness's ERP software.

It has been purpose-built for [Atarza](http://atarza.com)'s transition from the two softwares, so it makes assumptions based on our data in certain areas of the exports.

Exports were created for use with SQL Server 8.0.2039 (MOM) and SQL Server 10.50.1600 (CB).

__This is intended to be a jumping-off point,__ getting you part of the way there. You'll most likely need manual modifications done to each query to interact properly with your data.

To understand query structure, please reference the included Mind Map, usable with MindJet's MindManager software.
